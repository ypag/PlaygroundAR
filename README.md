# PlaygroundAR
Situated learning at playgrounds with augmented reality. This is my Thesis Project at Carnegie Mellon University in Fall 2015. OF addons used - ofxGui, ofxOpencv and ofxOpticalFlowFarneback (https://github.com/timscaffidi/ofxOpticalFlowFarneback)

Project analyses live video feed(pre recorded video file used in this example) and calculates velocity vectors at points of interest. A 2D game scenario is showcased to demonstrate future game usecases possible.
